Overview
This repository contains a Proof of Concept (POC) simulation for a proactive Utilization Review (UR) system powered by AI. The system is designed for a a Hospital in Illinois partnered with Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS). The goal is to show how AI can improve the UR process by predicting healthcare service needs early, ensuring appropriate care, and reducing unnecessary costs.

Key Features
AI-Driven Decisions: Simulates AI-based approval or denial of medical services (e.g., CT scans, admissions) based on predefined clinical policies.
Test Cases: Includes 8 test cases for the Acute Care domain, covering True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN).
Validation Harness: A test harness that runs the simulation, validates results, and provides insights into cost savings and decision accuracy.
Extensibility: Built to scale to other domains like Chronic Disease Management or Preventive Care.
Purpose
The POC highlights:

Speed: AI cuts decision time from minutes to seconds.
Cost Savings: Proactive UR reduces costs by avoiding unnecessary services.
Accuracy: AI aligns decisions with clinical guidelines, enhancing care quality.
Code Structure
The code is split into three main parts, designed to run in Google Colab:

Test Cases:
Defined in a Python dictionary (simulating JSON) in the first cell.
Contains 8 test cases for Acute Care, each with clinical inputs, expected decisions, and reasons.
UR Agent:
Implements decision-making policies for services (e.g., CT scans, admissions).
Uses simple rule-based logic to mimic AI decisions.
Test Harness:
Executes the simulation across all test cases.
Compares the agent's decisions to expected outcomes.
Outputs a summary of passed/failed tests, costs, and savings.# ProactiveUtilizationReviewMLR
